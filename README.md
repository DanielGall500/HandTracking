# Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition
###Created in C++ using OpenCV
---
**How It Works (so far):**

* Starts by capturing the camera feed from your computer

* Extracts the colour information from your hand and finds its mode

* Creates a binary representation (black and white pixels only) to filter out the hand from the
rest of the image

* Finds the contours (outline), hull (body of hand) and defects (for fingertips).

It will eventually have an implementation of gesture recognition and I hope to implement some much
more advanced features!
